RDD(1)                      General Commands Manual                     RDD(1)

NAME
     rdd – random data dump

SYNOPSIS
     rdd [-i source] [-r rekeymb] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     rdd is a high-speed, cryptographically safe random data generator using
     the reference implementation of the eSTREAM Profile 1 SOSEMANUK stream
     cipher.  It is designed to fill crypto devices with random data.

     Random binary data is outputted to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -i source
             Read key and IVs from source (default: /dev/urandom)

     -r rekeymb
             Reload the IV every rekeymb megabytes of output (default: 4).

     -v      Print a ‘.’ to standard error on every rekey.

EXIT STATUS
     The rdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     dd(1), random(4), random(7)

NOTES
     rdd reads 32 random bytes for the initial key and 16 bytes for every
     rekeying from the random source.  Setting rekeymb to -1 never rekeys.

     This implementation passed dieharder 3.31.1 "-a" and PractRand/RNG_test
     0.90 (tested up to 512 GB).
