RDD(1)                      General Commands Manual                     RDD(1)

NAME
     rdd – random data dump

SYNOPSIS
     rdd [-i source] [-r rekeymb] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     rdd is a high-speed, cryptographically safe random data generator using
     optimized versions of the ChaCha8 stream cipher, depending on your CPU.
     It is designed to fill crypto devices with random data.

     Random binary data is written to standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -i source
             Read key and IVs from source (default: /dev/urandom)

     -r rekeymb
             Reload the IV every rekeymb megabytes of output (default: 4).

     -v      Print a ‘.’ to standard error on every rekey.

EXIT STATUS
     The rdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     dd(1), random(4), random(7)

NOTES
     rdd reads 40 random bytes for the initial key and 32 bytes for every
     rekeying from the random source.  Setting rekeymb to -1 never rekeys.

     This implementation passed dieharder 3.31.1 "-a" and PractRand/RNG_test
     0.95 (tested up to 32 TB).
